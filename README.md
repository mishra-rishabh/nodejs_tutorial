complete nodejs concepts

* NodeJs is an open source and cross platform JS runtime environment. It allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
* It runs the v8 JS Engine, the chore of Google Chrome, outside the browser.
* It is light-weight.
* Fast: Node.js is very fast and can handle a large number of concurrent requests.
* Asynchronous programming: Node.js is single-threaded but highly scalable. It uses non-blocking I/O operations to handle multiple requests simultaneously.
* Event-driven architecture: Node.js is built on an event-driven architecture. This means that it reacts to events instead of waiting for them to happen. This makes it very efficient for asynchronous programming.
* Package manager: Node.js comes with a built-in package manager called npm. This makes it easy to install and manage Node.js modules.
* Large ecosystem: Node.js has a large and active ecosystem. There are thousands of Node.js modules available, covering a wide range of functionalities.
* Easy to learn: Node.js is relatively easy to learn, especially if you already have experience with JavaScript.

Node.js is a popular choice for developing web applications, microservices, and APIs.
