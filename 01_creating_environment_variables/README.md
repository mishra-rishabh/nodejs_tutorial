To make use of env variables, we have to follow the below steps-
1. Create .env file which contains your env variables.
2. To access these variables we have to install module called dotenv.
3. Use the dotenv module in the js file.
4. Use process module which is already builtin in nodejs to access the variables from .env file.

```
npm i dotenv
// or
npm install dotenv
```

rename the envFile to .env only
